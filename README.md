# JARVIS
A virtual personal assistant for Windows and conversational bot, the name is obviously inspired by Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S

### What JARVIS can do
Jarvis has two modes of operation, `query` and `conversation` <br>
#### Query mode
In this mode it can open applications, send email, search the web and ...  do many things that <br>
you expect from a virtual assistant.

#### Conversation mode (still in progess)
In this mode Jarvis turns into a conversational bot that you can speek with casually about anything. 

### How to use it
In order to try JARVIS simply download sources and run `requirements.py` script to download all requirements, then run `engine.py` and start talking

### Important notes
Like any AI assistants, JARVIS works with a combination of machine learning techniques and a lot of rules and written conditions which is unavoidable. <br>
So it's constantly improving and for it to have more features, more rules must be written.
